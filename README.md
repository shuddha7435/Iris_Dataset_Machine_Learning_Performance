# Iris_Dataset_Machine_Learning_Performance

I have compared the accuracy performance for these following algorithms in Python.
    •	Logistic Regression
    •	Linear Discriminant Analysis
    •	KNN
    •	Decision Tree Classifier
    •	Gaussian Naive Bayes
    •	Support Vector Machine
    
# Then I have also implemented a linear regression algorithm for a dataset both in Python and Scikit-learn.
