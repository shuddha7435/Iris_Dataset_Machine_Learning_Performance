# Here I have implemented different machine learning algorithms in Python.

• I have compared the accuracy performance for these following algorithms in Python for Iris_Dataset.
    •	Logistic Regression
    •	Linear Discriminant Analysis
    •	KNN
    •	Decision Tree Classifier
    •	Gaussian Naive Bayes
    •	Support Vector Machine
   
• Then I have also implemented a linear regression algorithm for a dataset both in Python and Scikit-learn.
• I have implemented the logistic regression analysis for titanic data and find the accuracy for survived passenger.
